The beacon software for hardware V4.5 is pretty large size now.
So full version (the file with "full" in file name suffix) is available only in DFU format for DFU uploading. 
With dashboard you can upload the file with "noNMEAnoSPI" in suffix (in hex format). 
This version not includes NMEA and SPI output, but its size allows to upload file via dashboard. 
This is useful for stationary beacons which can not output NMEA and SPI.
